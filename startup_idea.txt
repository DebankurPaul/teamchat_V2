Startup Idea: SmartGarden AI

Problem:
Many urban dwellers want to grow their own food but lack the knowledge, space, or time to maintain a garden. Plants often die due to over/under watering or lack of proper nutrients.

Solution:
SmartGarden AI is a modular, vertical gardening system integrated with IoT sensors and an AI app.
- Hardware: Stackable planters with built-in moisture, pH, and light sensors.
- Software: An app that uses the sensor data to automatically dispense water and nutrients.
- AI Feature: Take a photo of your plant, and the AI diagnoses diseases/pests and suggests organic remedies. It also predicts harvest times.

Business Model:
- Direct-to-consumer sales of the hardware units.
- Subscription model for nutrient refills and premium app features (expert consultations).
